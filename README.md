Jackalope: 

This is the first WordPress theme I've ever made. I am occasionally adding extra stuff to it occasionally, fixing bugs or adding immediately necessary functionality, but my major priority is to finish learning ReactJS so that I can just rebuild this sucker as a single page app that hooks into WordPress' Rest API. 



To Do:

- [x] add gulp preprocessing support
- [x] refactor scss and debug gulp render
- [x] refactor js and debug gulp render
- [x] refactor template structure
- [ ] ~~add Timber templating~~
- [x] remove underscores cruft

Deferred to next project:

- [ ] Rebuild frontend in React/Angular and hook into headless WP CMS using REST api (or Graph QL if it's mature enough)

- [ ] Or rebuild theme as React frontend and hook into Ghost CMS with REST API

- [x] rebuild custom galleries as custom Gutenberg block

- [ ] Separate out professional work from personal blog/projects for  a more focused presentation.

  - [ ] Distinguish posts by post tags instead of using custom post types
