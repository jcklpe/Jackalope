Jackalope: LEGACY

This is the first WP theme I ever developed. It's a mess. Going to be updating and retooling it. Getting it on github to make retooling and deploying it easier.

To Do:

- [x] add gulp preprocessing support
- [x] refactor scss and debug gulp render
- [x] refactor js and debug gulp render
- [x] refactor template structure
- [ ] ~~add Timber templating~~
- [x] remove underscores cruft

Deferred to next project:

- [ ] Rebuild frontend in React/Angular and hook into headless WP CMS using REST api (or Graph QL if it's mature enough)

- [ ] Or rebuild theme as React frontend and hook into Ghost CMS with REST API

- [ ] rebuild custom galleries as custom Gutenberg block

- [ ] Separate out professional work from personal blog/projects for  a more focused presentation.

  - [ ] Distinguish posts by post tags instead of using custom post types
